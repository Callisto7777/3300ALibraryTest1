Im going to send it over as a ZipFile I dont remember how to open it but just unzip it and go to VSCode and click open file then click on Skib01


-----------------------------------------------

Do not under any circumstance delete any of the code before imforming me
You can adjust values but do not delete any lines, this includes comments

You can use my code for other teams 
If they ask what library tell them Lemlib and Ez Template 

-----------------------------------------------

I recommend putting autosave on because i dont think either of you guys will have the habit of saving after everyrun
If the code doesnt work its prob because you changed something and you didnt save it

(Ctrl + S) if youre stupid
